# Auxilium

Auxilium is an open-source app for reporting emergencies. It informs nearby users that someone around them is in danger, and provides them with your location (and directions), so you can get help quickly.

## Motivation

In [my country]([wikipedia_link_to_nigeria]), many people die because of inability to access help quickly when they are involved in accidents or emergencies. I've always believed that many of these mortalities could have been averted, if people around would ave come to their aid.

## Installation

To install Auxilium on your machine, run these commands:

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/overthq/Auxilium
# Move into the project directory
cd Auxilium
# Install required dependencies
lerna bootstrap
# Start the entire project
lerna run start
```
